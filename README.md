# ShortCodingChallenges
Welcome to my list of short coding challenges. I have collected a few coding challenges that I found interesting. 
I have written solutions to them, some are brute force and some are super brain stormed! But I am enjoying the journey of exploring different challenges.
I mainly like to code in Java but it says it needs a buddy, so Javascript too!
